Recipe Notes 


What is it?

  This application lets you create and store individual recipes on a posted note style card.
  Each posted note will help you keep track of your recipes and store them for later reference.

How does it work?

  Click the posted note with the plus sign on it to create a new recipe note. Then you can add a title, ingredients, and directions for each recipe that you create.
  You can delete the ingredient and directions by clicking on them in side the posted note. You can also delete the entire recipe if you no longer want it.
  
What did I learn?

 I learned a lot about react states and learned how to use hooks effectively. I learned about the context api and how I can have a global store to keep track of all
 the recipes in one location.
