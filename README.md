What is it?

Create and store multiple recipes with this recipe app.

How does it work?

You can add new recipe cards for new recipes. Within each card, you can add a title, ingredients, and directions for your recipe. You can also edit them by deleting.

What did I learn?

I learned how to store data with useContext hook in react. This allowed for one source of truth for the recipe data. I also learned the use of local storage to keep the state of my application the same.
